## Part 1: WeatherPy

1. Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
2. Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

## Part 2: VacationPy
1. Use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualisations.

## Q & A 

Discussion about the linear relationship:
1. Temperature vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:

* Above graphs shows the relationship between temperature and latitude in the Nothern and Southern Hemisphere.
* Negative correlation in linear regression on Northern Hemisphere indicates that temperature tends to decrease with increasing latitude.
Positive correlation in linear regression on Southern Hemisphere indicates that temperature tends to increase with increasing latitude.
Above graphs shows the relationship between temperature and latitude in the Nothern and Southern Hemisphere.
* Negative correlation in linear regression on Northern Hemisphere indicates that temperature tends to decrease with increasing latitude.
* Positive correlation in linear regression on Southern Hemisphere indicates that temperature tends to increase with increasing latitude.

2.  Humidity vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:

* Positive slope indicates in both Nothern and Southern Hemispheres indicates, when it moves toward higher latitudes, humidity tends to increase.
* Negative slope indicates, when it moves toward higher latitudes, humidity tends to decrease.

3. Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot

* Above graphs shows the correlation between cloudiness and latitude in the Nothern and Southern Hemisphere.
* Both of them indicates a positive slope which suggests that cloudiness tends to increase with increasing latitude.

4. Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
Discussion about the linear relationship:

* Northern Hemisphere linear regression plot indicates a slight positive increase (minor positive slope) which suggests that suggest when it moves toward higher latitudes, wind speed tends to increase.
* Southern Hemisphere linear regression plot indicates a negative slope which suggests when it moves towards higher latitudes, wind speed tends to decrease.
